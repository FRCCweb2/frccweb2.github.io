          Rebecca is an inquisitive sixth-grader who has just moved to a new
          town with her family. Though anxious, she is ready for a fresh start.
          Rebecca has a secret: she can see ghosts, and everyone at her old
          school thought she was out of her mind. She hopes to forget the past
          and make new friends who think she is completely normal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Things don’t get off to a great start; on her first day of school she
          not only discovers the ghost of a boy haunting her backyard, but a
          group of bullies force her into helping them torment the only girl in
          class who was nice to her. As if that weren’t enough, she discovers
          that the ghost boy’s murderer (known as The Twilight Reaper in life)
          is still around, and looking for another victim.
