    </div>
    <div class="kp">
    <p>Kayori is a young boy living in the mighty Amazon rainforest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      When a deadly disease strikes his tribe and he is the only one still
      healthy, he must leave his home and journey to a distant mountain. A
      powerful goddess dwells at the summit in the form of a feathered serpent,
      and it is rumored that just one of her feathers can cure any disease.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Along the way Kayori will make unexpected friendships and overcome
      insurmountable odds.
